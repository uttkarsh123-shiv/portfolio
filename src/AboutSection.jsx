         I am a passionate Computer Science student at MAIT, driven by a love for 
         design and development. I enjoy turning ideas into seamless digital experiences 
         and continuously honing my skills. <br />
          <br />
          I love crafting clean, intuitive designs â€” but what excites me even
          more is bringing those designs to life through thoughtful development.
          From pixels to performance, I aim to create solutions that are not
          just usable, but memorable.
