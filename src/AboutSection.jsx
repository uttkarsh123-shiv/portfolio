          I am a passionate Computer Science student at MAIT, driven by a love
          for design and development. I enjoy turning ideas into seamless
          digital experiences and continuously honing my skills. <br />
          <br />I love crafting clean, intuitive designs â€” but what excites me
          even more is bringing those designs to life through thoughtful
          development. From pixels to performance, I aim to create solutions
          that are not just usable, but memorable.
